Test Strategy 
Application name : Internet based Derivatives Trading Division
1. Assess testabality-(each factor on a scale of 1-5)
 a. operabality---> 4
 b. controlability--->5
 c. observability-->5
 d. simplicity--->3	
 e. understandability--->5
 f. Suitability--->3
 g. Stability----->2

2. Assess the test factors that has to be considered for testing the software:
a. Correctness
b. Authorization
c. Continuity of Processing
d. Access Control
e. Reliability	
f. Integrity
g. Performance  

3. Identify the lifecycle stages of this factors in levels of testing
a. Authorization : It is done under Integration testing. 
b. Correctness    : It is done under Integration testing
c. Continuity of processing : It is done in post UAT(User Acceptance Testing)
d. Access Control : It comes under System Testing
e .Reliability : This is one of the factor which comes in all the product.It is done under User Acceptance testing.
f. Performace : It is done in the System testing.
g. Integrity : It is done in the System Testing.

4. Assess drivers that would influence testing:
a. Authorization  : It is done under Integration testing. 
-->Integration testing is done by Test Engineer/Tester.
--->Authorization comes under Validation Phase
--->Integration testing is black box testing
b. Correctness  : It is done under Integration testing
-->Integration testing is done by Test Engineer/Tester.
--->Correctness comes under Validation Phase
--->Integration testing is black box testing	
c. Continuity of processing : It is done in post UAT(User Acceptance Testing)
-->Client/Manager is responsible post UAT(User Acceptance Testing)
--It requires Black Box Testing.
-Continuity of processing comes under Verification phase.
D. Access Control : It comes under System Testing
---->System Testing is done by the Test Engineer.
----->Access Control comes under Verification phase.
----->System testing is black box testing.
e. Reliability : This is one of the factor which comes in all the product.It is done under User Acceptance testing.
--->User Acceptance Testing is done by the Client.
-User Acceptance Testing is Black Box Testing.
-Reliability comes under Validation Phase.
f. Performace : It is done under System testing.
---->System Testing is done by the Test Engineer.
-- System testing is Black Box Testing
--Performance comes under Validation.
g. Integrity : It is done under System Testing.
---->System Testing is done by the Test Engineer	
 --System Testing is Black Box Testing
-Integrity comes under Validation phase.
Test Plan:Created by Test Lead/Senior Tester

4. Features not to be Tested : New version not to be tested because that is not part of the scope.
5. Approach : Approach includes both the White box and Black box testing beacuse it contains code and UI.
6. Test Deliverables : Documents we are going to create are Source Code,Test Scenario,Test plan,Test case,Test execution Report,Test report, Defect Report.
7. Item pass/Fail Criteria : If i find 5 minor bug,1 major bug, with No critical/show Stopper in this case i consider the application as pass criteria.
8. Suspension and Resumption Criteria : Show stoppers in application/Non Availability of resource.Resumption is when the issue is resolved.
9. Responsibility : It includes the work/Responsibility of project manager,Test Lead,Tester,Customers.
10. Staffing and Training Need : It includes the details like How many tester are required/which all the area you need training.
